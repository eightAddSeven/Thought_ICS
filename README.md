**Iterative Correction Sampling of Thoughts (Thought-ICS)** — a framework for studying
self-correction in language models by generating reasoning *thought-by-thought*, localizing
the first erroneous step, and backtracking to resample from the last correct point.

> **TL;DR.** We show that language models can explicitly self-localize errors in incorrect reasoning
> when it is structured as discrete, semantically coherent thought steps, enabling effective
> self-correction through targeted backtracking and resampling.

This repository contains the method, baselines, and evaluation harness.

## The idea

Self-correction for LLMs is usually done by **critiquing an answer and regenerating the entire
reasoning trace**. We show that **targeted backtrack-and-resample works better**: self-localize the
first erroneous step, then sample a counterfactual from there — self-correction as a *targeted
intervention* rather than wholesale regeneration.

The crux is **self-localization**. Rather than asking whether LLMs can localize errors in arbitrary
traces, we take a different angle: **generate the reasoning so that localization is tractable in the
first place** — as a discrete chain of semantically coherent thoughts with clear boundaries.

Inspired by how the brain's anterior cingulate cortex monitors errors at discrete decision points
(not individual neurons, not whole behaviors), Thought-ICS generates reasoning as discrete thoughts,
localizes the first error at that granularity, and resamples from the last correct step.

### Thought MDP (thought-by-thought generation)

Standard CoT is a single token-level rollout. A **Thought MDP** keeps the same model but changes
the *action space*: each action is a complete reasoning step (a "thought"), delimited by a stop
marker the model emits. Same `p_θ`, different prompting — but now the trace has principled
boundaries that can be traversed, verified, and edited step by step.

```
Algorithm 1 — Thought-by-thought generation
  Input: question x, policy π_thought, max depth D
  s ← x
  repeat
      a ~ π_thought(· | s)      # sample next thought
      s ← s ⊕ a                 # append thought to state
  until s contains an answer or max depth reached
  return s
```

### The Thought-ICS correction loop

<p align="center"><img src="figures/tree_visualization.png" width="95%"></p>

**Generation → Verification → Localization → Resampling**, iterated. Verification gates the loop
(self- or oracle-verification). On a flagged response, the model is shown its full numbered trace
and asked for the *first* erroneous thought; the scaffold backtracks to that point and resamples a
new continuation from the shared prefix. The loop exits on one of three conditions:
**(1) Verified Accuracy**, **(2) V/L Disagreement** (verifier flags an error, localizer finds none),
or **(3) MaxIter**.

```
Framework 1 — Thought-ICS
  Input: question x, max iterations L
  τ ← Generate(x)                          # Thought MDP (Alg. 1)
  repeat
      return τ if Verify(τ)                # (1) Verified Accuracy
      e ← localize first erroneous thought in τ
      return τ if e = ∅                    # (2) V/L Disagreement
      τ_prefix ← τ[:e]                     # backtrack to thought e−1
      τ ← Generate(τ_prefix)               # resample correction
  until max iterations                     # (3) MaxIter
  return τ
```

**Token-ICS** is the unstructured baseline: the same localize → backtrack → resample loop, but on a
continuous CoT trace where the model must *quote* the erroneous span instead of naming a step.

## Results

We evaluate **8 models (3B–120B)** — LLaMA-3 (3B/8B/70B), Qwen-2.5 (7B/14B/32B), GPT-OSS (20B/120B) —
across **6 benchmarks**: AMC23, AIME, MATH500-L5, MathQA, CSQA, GPQA. Figures are averaged over all six
datasets unless noted.

### 1. Structure improves self-correction under oracle verification

Using an oracle to filter for genuinely-wrong solutions, both methods backtrack-and-resample from a
localized error. Self-correction lift is **larger and more uniform for Thought-ICS (red)** than for
unstructured Token-ICS (green). Part of the lift comes from thought-by-thought generation itself
(light red); the rest from localization-driven correction (solid red).

<p align="center"><img src="figures/l2_errorbar.png" width="80%"></p>

### 2. Structure enables precise self-localization

The objective when backtracking is a **clean prefix**: a sequence of thoughts free of any decision
that would derail the reasoning (self ≤ oracle); otherwise the prefix is *erroneous*. Within
structured reasoning, models reach a clean prefix far more often — and the gap grows with scale.

<p align="center">
<img src="figures/self_localization_vs_oracle.png" width="46%">
<img src="figures/edit_accuracy_clean_vs_erroneous.png" width="46%">
</p>

*Left:* clean prefixes (exact match + earlier) vs erroneous, per model.
*Right:* this verifies the premise of backtrack-and-resample directly — sampling counterfactuals from
a **clean prefix corrects 2–4× more often** than from an erroneous one. Precise localization is what
makes the correction land.

The deviation between self- and oracle-localization is **tight and centered at zero for large
models**, confirming the lift comes from precise localization, not conservatism (just blaming step 1):

<p align="center"><img src="figures/localization_error_distribution.png" width="65%"></p>

> Oracle localization is a consensus of three frontier models (Claude-Sonnet-3.7, GPT-4.1,
> GPT-5-mini): 51% unanimous, 74% within ±1 step, 85% within ±2 steps.

**Without structure, localization is inconsistent.** On unstructured CoT, models localize *later*
than the oracle and miss root causes — only **30–45% clean prefixes vs 60–80% for Thought-ICS**:

<p align="center"><img src="figures/self_localization_vs_oracle_token.png" width="65%"></p>

### 3. A fully autonomous system (no oracle)

> **Autonomy levels.** The `--autonomy-level` flag controls how much oracle support the
> verify→localize→resample loop receives — each level strips away one more piece of external help:
> - **L1 — Oracle:** ground truth drives both verification and localization (the model is told *where* the error is).
> - **L2 — Binary oracle:** the model is told only *that* the trace is wrong; it must self-localize the erroneous step.
> - **L3 — Autonomous:** no oracle — the model self-verifies *and* self-localizes. This is the fully
>   autonomous setting these results target (and what the Thought-ICS-A confidence safeguard protects).
>
> **Conditioning the resample (`--context`, orthogonal to the level above).** By default the counterfactual
> is a fresh **stochastic sample** from the clean prefix. Passing `--context` instead *conditions* that resample
> on the previous failed chain and the error analysis from the prior iteration. This conditioning is
> independent of the oracle level and can be combined with any of L1/L2/L3. We find that small LMs cannot
> yet make effective use of this explicit error feedback, so **the paper focuses on stochastic sampling from
> the clean prefix**; conditioning is provided for completeness and as a direction for larger models.

Zooming in on how the sub-skills of self-correction **scale**: localization improves with model size
(bigger models are genuinely more precise), and resampling tracks localization quality. But
**self-verification does not reliably scale** — making it the bottleneck for autonomous
self-correction.

**Self-verification degrades over iterations.** Stratified by terminal iteration, *recall* rises but
*specificity* collapses — models increasingly fail to recognize correct answers and break them:

<p align="center"><img src="figures/self_verification_by_terminal_iteration_part1a.png" width="65%"></p>

Averaged over iterations, every self-verification gating strategy **breaks more than it fixes**.
Sampling 9 verifications per step and varying strictness (Any / Majority / Unanimous) only shifts the
recall–specificity trade-off:

| Method     | Recall | Specificity | Broke | Fixed |
|------------|:------:|:-----------:|:-----:|:-----:|
| Single     | 68.3%  | 66.9%       | 10.9% | 6.2%  |
| Any        | 94.6%  | 30.9%       | 21.4% | 8.1%  |
| Majority   | 70.2%  | 69.9%       | 12.7% | 6.3%  |
| Unanimous  | 34.7%  | 94.6%       | 6.0%  | 3.5%  |

**Confidence safeguard → Thought-ICS-A.** Breakage concentrates in two exit conditions. Resetting to
the initial response on those low-confidence exits (and only keeping corrections that pass verified
accuracy) turns the method net-positive:

| Termination condition       | Broke | Fixed | Net Lift |
|-----------------------------|:-----:|:-----:|:--------:|
| (1) Verified Accuracy       | 2.5%  | 6.4%  | **+3.9%** |
| (2) V/L Disagreement        | 51.3% | 2.0%  | −49.3%   |
| (3) MaxIter                 | 77.4% | 5.4%  | −72.0%   |

<p align="center"><img src="figures/self_verification_by_terminal_iteration_part1b.png" width="65%"></p>

**Toward fully autonomous self-correction.** Run with no oracle (Thought-ICS-A, with the confidence
safeguard), this shows the benefits of backtracking and resampling within structured reasoning over
unstructured-CoT full-regeneration baselines such as **Self-Refine** and **CoVe**. The benefits
surface mainly in **larger models (~14B and up)**, where self-localization is precise enough for
targeted correction to pay off; smaller models, with noisier localization and weaker
self-verification, see limited gains.

<p align="center"><img src="figures/self_correction_lift_errorbar.png" width="65%"></p>

> Additional analyses (token-level localization, per-model self-verification, chain-length
> distributions, compute efficiency) and the figures behind them are in [`figures/`](figures/).

**Takeaway.** By structuring reasoning as a chain of semantically coherent thoughts *at generation
time*, self-localization becomes tractable — enabling self-correction as a targeted intervention
rather than wholesale regeneration.

## Installation

Requires Python ≥ 3.9 and a CUDA GPU for local inference (vLLM). API-only runs need no GPU.

Dependencies are managed with **pip via `requirements.txt`**. If you already have a suitable Python:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt   # all library dependencies
pip install -e .                  # the thought_ics package itself
```

`environment.yml` is provided only to provision the Python version and an isolated conda env —
libraries still install through pip:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml   # creates the 'thought-ics' env (Python 3.12 + pip)
conda activate thought-ics
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

---

## Usage

All entry points are run as modules (`python -m thought_ics.<...>`).

**Thought-ICS (thought-by-thought generation + correction).** Set `--autonomy-level` to
`1` Oracle, `2` Binary oracle, or `3` Autonomous; add `--context` to condition the resample on the
prior iteration's error (any level). See [**Autonomy levels**](#3-a-fully-autonomous-system-no-oracle)
above for what each means.

```bash
# L3 joint self-localization diagnostic (no separate verification gate)
python -m thought_ics.eval.batch_eval \
    --autonomy-level 3 --dataset math500 --model llama8b \
    --gpus 0,1 --tensor-parallel-size 2 --n-problems 100

# Table 4 autonomous protocol. --verify gives Thought-ICS-S; adding the
# confidence safeguard selects Thought-ICS-A. The result files report the
# paired S and A accuracies from the same sampled trajectories.
python -m thought_ics.eval.batch_eval \
    --autonomy-level 3 --verify --confidence-safeguard \
    --prompt-profile paper \
    --dataset amc23 --model qwen32b \
    --gpus 0,1,2,3 --tensor-parallel-size 4 --n-problems 40

# Oracle-verification setting (L2): model is told it's wrong and must self-localize
python -m thought_ics.eval.batch_eval \
    --autonomy-level 2 --dataset aime --model qwen7b \
    --gpus 0 --tensor-parallel-size 1
```

Available `--model`: `llama3b llama8b llama70b qwen7b qwen14b qwen32b gptoss20b gptoss120b`.
Available `--dataset`: `amc23 aime math500 mathqa csqa gpqa`.

**Run via an OpenAI-compatible API** instead of a local GPU (`--3p` routes all inference through the API):

```bash
# No GPU needed: --gpus / --tensor-parallel-size are not required under --3p
python -m thought_ics.eval.batch_eval \
    --autonomy-level 3 --dataset amc23 \
    --3p --3p-model gpt-4o --3p-api-key $OPENAI_API_KEY
```

For an API-only installation (including Windows), omit the local inference stack:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-api.txt
pip install -e . --no-deps
```

The API configuration can be supplied with environment variables. `OPENAI_BASE_URL` is optional
for the official OpenAI endpoint and enables any OpenAI-compatible provider; `OPENAI_MODEL` defaults
to `gpt-4o` when omitted.

```powershell
$env:OPENAI_API_KEY = "your-api-key"
$env:OPENAI_BASE_URL = "https://your-provider.example/v1"  # optional
$env:OPENAI_MODEL = "your-model-name"                      # optional
.\scripts\run_api.cmd -Dataset amc23 -NProblems 1
```

The equivalent CLI options are `--3p-api-key`, `--3p-base-url`, and `--3p-model`. Prefer the
environment variable for the API key so it does not appear in shell history or process arguments.
The `.cmd` launcher works even when direct PowerShell script execution is disabled and does not
change the machine's persistent execution policy.

For the verified Windows workflow used to reproduce the Qwen2.5-14B AMC23 result, including
model/dataset switching, preflight checks, resume behavior, and result inspection, see
[`API_EXPERIMENT_GUIDE.zh-CN.md`](API_EXPERIMENT_GUIDE.zh-CN.md).

**Baselines:**

```bash
# Token-ICS: unstructured-CoT correction where the model quotes the erroneous span
# (--mode selects the built-in problem set: simple, amc, or both; --gpu is a single GPU id)
python -m thought_ics.baselines.token_ics --mode both --model llama8b --gpu 0 --n-problems 100

# Iterative-CoT baselines (--baseline-type: single | iterative_l1..l3 | iterative_no_gt |
# iterative_with_gt | majority_vote; add --context for historical-context conditioning)
python -m thought_ics.baselines.cot_eval \
    --baseline-type iterative_l2 --dataset math500 --model llama8b \
    --gpus 0 --tensor-parallel-size 1

# Self-Refine and Chain-of-Verification (--method: self_refine | cove)
python -m thought_ics.baselines.third_party.eval_3p_baselines \
    --method self_refine --dataset math500 --model llama8b --gpus 0
```

**Oracle error-localization pipeline** (used to build the localization figures):

```bash
# 1) export localization prompts from completed runs
python -m thought_ics.localization.export_prompts --experiments "experiments/eval_*" --output prompts.jsonl
# 2) judge them offline with frontier models -> responses.jsonl
# 3) match judge responses back and compute agreement
python -m thought_ics.localization.match_results --prompts prompts.jsonl --responses responses.jsonl
```

**Metrics & majority-vote verification:**

```bash
python -m thought_ics.metrics experiments/<run_dir>                 # compute metrics.json for a run
python -m thought_ics.verification.mv_verification --model llama3b --dataset aime --n-problems 100
```

Each run writes a directory under `experiments/` containing `results.json` (full traces),
`metrics.json`, and `config.json`.

> **Note:** this is a code release. The raw experiment outputs and judge responses that back the
> paper figures are not shipped; the commands above regenerate them.

### Prompts: refined defaults (recommended) vs. paper originals

By default the pipeline now loads the **refined** thought-by-thought generation and
error-localization prompts, delimiter, and knobs from
[`thought_ics/recommended_prompts.py`](thought_ics/recommended_prompts.py) — these come from our
follow-up experiments and give the best results. They sharpen *originating-cause* localization
(target the step where reasoning first derailed, not where the wrong answer surfaces), use cleaner
step-by-step generation, stop only on `</thought>`, and set `max_thoughts=20`,
`max_tokens_per_thought=512`, `max_ics_iterations=10` (temperatures unchanged).

The **exact prompts used in the paper** are preserved in
[`thought_ics/paper_prompts.py`](thought_ics/paper_prompts.py) for reference / exact reproduction
(pass `paper_prompts.GENERATION_PROMPT` to `ToTEnvironment(prompt_template=...)` and use
`paper_prompts.localization_prompt(...)`). Note: fully-autonomous L3 localization keeps its
original prompt (it must be able to report "no error" via `\boxed{0}`).
